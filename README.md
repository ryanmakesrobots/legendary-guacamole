I needed a way of creating folders within a share depending on assessed group membership in Windows. I came up with this as a scheduled task.

Features: </br>
ğŸ’» Creation of user folders in a share and assigning ACL permissions based on AD Group Membership </br>
ğŸ’» Assessed membership of group; if user removed from group, their access is also revoked but folder is held in place
